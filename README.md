## Changelog
### task2-serve-spa-aws
- S3 bucket has been created and configured properly. The app has been uploaded to the bucket and is available though the Internet.
- In addition to the previous work a CloudFront distribution is created and configured properly and the site is served now with CloudFront and is available through the Internet over CloudFront URL, not S3-website link (due to changes in bucketâ€™s policy).
- Serverless-finch and serverless-single-page-app plugins are added and configured. The app can be built and deployed by running npm script command.
